		<p class='intro__paragraph intro__paragraph_first'>Hobbies. Without them life would be a tedious existence in and out of our boring  jobs. That of course if youâ€™re lucky enough to have a job, or one that pays well, or even one that you enjoy.  What ever the case, hobbies give meaning to our lives.</p>
		<p class='intro__paragraph intro__paragraph_last'>Here is a non-exhaustive list of the hobbies that have kept me going. Don't forget to go through your own list, and give life back to your own ones.</p>

			<p >
				This folks, is the great-great-grandfather of the modern guitar. Today, the 'Oud as it is called, is played widely accross the Middle East and Africa north of the Sahara.</p>
			<p>Unlike the guitar or the medieval lute, the 'Oud has no frets, much like a violin or a cello, which essential for music styles that require more notes than the western 12-note range.</p>

				<img class='card__img' alt='Playing the ukulele' src="ukulele.png">
			</div>
			<div class='card__paragraph'>
			<p class=>
				I also play other instruments. This tiny guitar was made intentionally small for individual preferences. This transformation started a few hundred years ago in Europe.</p>
			<p class=>This particular instrument is called ukulele, of which there are different sizes also. In Colombia, where I come from, we have a slightly bigger version called 'cuatro' which means four, because it has four strings.</p>
			<p class=>I play Colombian music on a Hawaiian instrument. Isn't that cool.</p>

				<img class='card__img' alt='Yoga pose' src="yoga_pose.jpeg">
			</div>
			<div class='card__paragraph'>
			<p class=>
				Getting sporty! Ok, you cannot see my face, but trust me, it's me. I've been practising yoga most of my adult life. Without it I'd probably be intitutionalized. At the same time, I keep fit.</p> 
			<p class=>If you need yoga in your life please <a href= 'https://www.youtube.com/@yogawithcarlos'>visit my Youtube channel for easy to follow yoga lessons.</a></p>

				<img class='card__img' alt='Waining moon' src="moon.jpg">
			</div>
			<div class='card__paragraph'>
			<p class=>
				I also love astronomy. Looking up to the skyes has always fascinated me. Our planet, the solar system, our own galaxy and the vastness of the universe is mindblowing and humbling.</p> 
			<p class=>This is a picture of the waining moon. Ok, it's not a good picture, but I took that picture myself. You heard it. No tools required, just access to the internet.</p>
			<p class=>With <a href='https://mo-www.cfa.harvard.edu/OWN/about.html'>Observing with NASA</a> you can control several ground-based telescopes and choose the target yourself. </p>

				<img class='card__img' alt='rollerblading in the park' src="rollerblades.jpeg">
			</div>
			<div class='card__paragraph'>
			<p class=>
				I can't say I'm a sporty person. I try to keep relativily fit though. I practice yoga every morning and I cycle to work. This summer I took up rollerblading and I love it. Now that it is winter I don't really do it, but I'm looking forward to warmer days so I can go to the park I put on some wheels.
